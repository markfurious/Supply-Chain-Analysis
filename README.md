# Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive supply chain dataset to extract valuable insights aimed at maximizing profits and minimizing losses. Utilizing various data analysis techniques, we identify key trends and patterns that inform strategic decisions within supply chain management.

## Objectives
- **Identify Key Features**: Select at least five significant features from the dataset for in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover relationships in sales, profit margins, shipment delays, customer behavior, and fraud detection.
- **Generate Insights**: Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:
- **[Supply Chain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis)**
- **Features**: The dataset contains 53 features and 180,519 rows, including important attributes such as sales, profit per order, shipping details, and customer information.

## Key Findings
1. **Sales and Profit Analysis**: The top regions for sales and profits were identified, with the Fan Shop and Apparel categories leading in performance.
2. **Shipment Delay Analysis**: A significant percentage of deliveries (55%) were late, affecting profitability.
3. **Top Customers**: The analysis highlighted the top five customers by profit, showcasing their purchasing behavior.
4. **Fraud Analysis**: Potential fraudulent transactions were identified, particularly involving direct transfer payment methods.
